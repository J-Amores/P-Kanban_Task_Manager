# Kanban Task Management Web App - Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

The Kanban Task Management Web App is a responsive web application that allows users to create and manage tasks using the Kanban methodology. The application provides an intuitive interface for creating boards, columns, and tasks, with the ability to move tasks between different stages of completion.

## 2. Target Platforms

- Include a sidebar that displays all boards
- Implement ability to hide/show the sidebar
- Enable users to switch between different boards via the sidebar

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Board Management
- **Create Boards**: Users should be able to create new boards via "Create New Board" option in sidebar
- **Read Boards**: Users should be able to view all created boards in the sidebar

- **Update Tasks**: Users should be able to edit task details
  - Updating a task's status should move it to the appropriate column
- **Delete Tasks**: Users should be able to delete tasks
- **Subtasks**: 
  - Tasks can contain subtasks
  - Users should be able to mark subtasks as complete or incomplete

### 4.4. Bonus Features
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between columns

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1. Development Stack
- Next.js for the frontend framework
- Zustand for state management
- CSS for styling
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### 5.2. Implementation Approach
- Mobile-first workflow for responsive design
- Utilize the Drag and Drop API for task movement functionality
- Take advantage of Next.js features:
  - Server-side rendering for improved performance
  - File-based routing for simplified navigation
  - API routes for backend functionality if needed

## 6. User Experience Guidelines

### 6.1. Expected Behaviors
- Clicking different boards in the sidebar changes the active board
- Clicking "Create New Board" opens the "Add New Board" modal
- Clicking "Edit Board" in the dropdown menu opens the "Edit Board" modal
- Columns can be added/removed in the Add/Edit Board modals

- New tasks are added to the bottom of their respective column
- Changing a task's status moves it to the corresponding column

## 7. Accessibility

- Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard
- Implement proper ARIA attributes where necessary
- Use semantic HTML to improve screen reader compatibility

## 8. Performance Considerations

- Optimize asset loading for fast initial page load
- Implement efficient state management to handle complex board structures
- Ensure smooth transitions and interactions, particularly for drag-and-drop operations

## 9. Deployment

- The application should be deployed to a hosting service like Netlify
